are we using self lock everywhere we could? (plexer interruptionlock could be self,)
dispatch_queue_get_current and autorelease? (passing name string to queue create, etc)
adopt syslog/journalctl?
ymtest ends up with dozens of threads
debug hooks to summarize busyness of worker threads (time delta slept/woken)
split session/plexer etc client and server into separate implementation files?
convert mdns to dispatch
give reverse domains to all user queues
implement a compression provider and test on repetitive data across the wire
what to do about ymlog vs dispatch startup deadlock (ymsemaphore now printf'd)
task output is truncated (it's max=512 in __YMLogType)
periodic running summary of compression performance
subprocess and parameterize Tests, its weird main thread state stack pointers and lack of dispatchmain service
dispatch source, especially currently unused writeability test case
find a way to test for endianness (linux mips simulator?)
forward test for connection stream init failure
plexertest releases its queues but they're not being freed
get to a point where YMThread is private
queue probably should not be a ymtype
make the poll/epoll version of sources
QUEUE LIFECYCLE / THREAD EXIT TASK FORCE
  sources is a non-ymtyped array with a nested ymtype
  test dispatchafter to queue that exits in the interim

big ideas from ~10 years ago:
- write complete build instructions based off clean w32 & debian installs
- adaptive sample, time based, short-circuit for convergence

- release config for makefile
- uint8_t buf params are tedious, take void and cast bytewise internally
- abolish file/socket distinction in a winsock friendly way
- test on santa monita "City WiFi" and philz, funny biznass
  ``NOTE WELL:'' PHILZ IN SANTA MONICA DOESNT SERVE BAGELS DUE TO HEALTH REGULATIONS
- add netmask to if map
- awdl support
- samples should be time-based
- journaled streams
- ensure over-the-wire enums are explicitly sized
- 'direct connect' (bypass mdns/support "internet")
- YM_ONCE_DEF-like macro for generic thread/dispatch boilerplate
- shared "dispatch queues"
- adopt spinlocks where appropriate
- generalize copy file / recursive delete dir into utilities, or something
- __YMRetain(obj,off)
- match plexer buffer / max i/o to connection mtu?
- __YMX509CertificateCreateX509 is misinterpreting errors from various openssl 'namespaces'
- eliminate redundant framing between forward file and plexer
- need test case for forward-file "opaque" (unbounded), e.g. bom stream close case

- connection ownership/lifetime not clear
- inlines
- convenience for "my user data is length-prefixed with x width, too"
- mDNS filter local services
- muxer protocol renegotiate
- service all ready downstreams in single loop, lock optimization
- {h,n}to{n,h}, if exchange
