- journaled streams
- ensure over-the-wire enums are explicitly sized
- YM_ONCE_DEF-like macro for generic thread/dispatch boilerplate
- shared "dispatch queues"
- adopt spinlocks where appropriate
- generalize copy file / recursive delete dir into utilities, or something
- __YMRetain(obj,off)
- server session's port order is backwards
- match plexer buffer / max i/o to connection mtu?
- __YMX509CertificateCreateX509 is misinterpreting errors from various openssl 'namespaces'
- eliminate redundant framing between forward file and plexer
- need test case for forward-file "opaque" (unbounded), e.g. bom stream close case

- 'self lock'
- connection ownership/lifetime not clear
- inlines
- convenience for "my user data is length-prefixed with x width, too"
- mDNS filter local services
- muxer protocol renegotiate
- plexer chunk-chunk instead of realloc (and test large single user i/o vs plex buf)
- service all ready downstreams in single loop, lock optimization
- {h,n}to{n,h}
- awkward to mix [un]managed types in collections
