- shared dispatch queues
- adopt spinlocks where appropriate
- generalize copy file / recursive delete dir into utilities, or something
- __YMRetain(obj,off) optimization
- server session's port order is backwards
- match plexer buffer / max i/o to connection mtu?
- __YMX509CertificateCreateX509 is misinterpreting errors from various openssl 'namespaces'
- eliminate redundant framing between forward file and plexer
- myabort, so aborts can be switched on and off, or at least not require a compound block, soft and hard for debugging vs internal error
- need test case for forward-file "opaque" (unbounded), e.g. bom stream close case

- adopt 'synchronized self'? mutexes not small
- connection ownership/lifetime not clear
- automatic log indentation by level
- inlines
- per-.c log level boilerplate
- linked list
- if apple syslog
- convenience for "my user data is length-prefixed with x width, too"
- mDNS filter local services
- typedef struct __X {} _X; and Ref pass
- muxer protocol renegotiate?
- plexer chunk-chunk instead of realloc (and test large single user i/o vs plex buf)
- service all ready downstreams in single loop, lock optimization
- {h,n}to{n,h}
- convenience to consolidate dispatch boilerplate for clients
