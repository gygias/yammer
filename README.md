# yammer

Yammer is a C library for managing multiple concurrent streams over a single socket connection, over the local network, with configurable encryption and per-stream compression. It also profiles available routes between hosts with multiple network interfaces, allowing the user to adopt a faster connection method should one become available after the initial connection is made, and seamlessly reconnects if a disconnection occurs.

The library aims to be fully platform-agnostic, supporting Windows, OS X, iOS, Linux (and ostensibly Android, though I don't have access to one). VS2015 solution, Xcode project, makefile, Cocoa & .NET (work in progress) wrapper frameworks and fairly comprehensive test suite are included. The main interface is YMSession. Users specify an mDNS service type (e.g. _myappproto._tcp). Servers then 'advertise' a service with a given name (e.g. MyApp on David's iPhone). Clients can easily enumerate and connect to service instances by name, configuring security for the connection, and create arbitrarily many bi-directional, full-duplex streams over the connection.

Yammer depends on OpenSSL and mDNSResponder (a.k.a. Bonjour), which are included on Apple and available for Linux & Windows platforms. OpenSSL dlls/libs for Win32 and iOS are included. Debian build requires the libbz2-dev package, and mDNS (apple's distribution, or avahi). Less handsy build instructions to come with 1.0 release.
